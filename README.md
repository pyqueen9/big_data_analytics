#  Page Rank for Wikipedia pages in Scala & Spark 

Assignments from a course on Big Data Analytics.

The two scripts are implementations in Scala for Google's Page Rank algorithm on the Wikipedia pages dataset (can test on the full-sized version ~50GB or a "mini dump" dataset (< 5GB).

One assignment is a general Page Rank program which outputs the list of scores for each page ranked in descending order.

The other assignment is Topic-based Page Rank which can find relevant pages based on a topic and outputs their scores.
